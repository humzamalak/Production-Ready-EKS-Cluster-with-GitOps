## 4. User Stories

### 4.1 DevOps Engineer Stories
**Story 1: Infrastructure Deployment**
```
As a DevOps engineer,
I want to deploy a complete EKS infrastructure with a single command,
So that I can quickly provision new environments without manual configuration.
```

**Story 2: Application Management**
```
As a DevOps engineer,
I want to manage application deployments through Git commits,
So that all changes are tracked and can be easily rolled back.
```

### 4.2 Development Team Stories
**Story 3: Self-Service Deployment**
```
As a developer,
I want to deploy my application by updating a YAML file in Git,
So that I don't need to learn kubectl or complex deployment procedures.
```

**Story 4: Environment Promotion**
```
As a developer,
I want to promote my application from staging to production,
So that I can deploy tested changes with confidence.
```

### 4.3 SRE Stories
**Story 5: Infrastructure Monitoring**
```
As an SRE,
I want to monitor cluster health and application performance,
So that I can proactively identify and resolve issues.
```
