# Infrastructure Applications

This directory is reserved for infrastructure-level applications that are not environment-specific.

## Planned Applications

- **Ingress Controllers**: NGINX, Traefik, or other ingress controllers
- **Cert-Manager**: Certificate management for TLS
- **External DNS**: DNS record management
- **Cluster Autoscaler**: Node scaling configuration
- **Backup Solutions**: Velero or similar backup tools

## Current Status

This directory is currently empty but is reserved for future infrastructure components that need to be deployed across all environments.

## Usage

Infrastructure applications should be deployed before environment-specific applications to ensure proper dependencies are met.
