# Documentation Update Summary

Date: 2025-10-05

## Updated Files

- `README.md` — Verified structure, scripts, and cross-links; high-level only.
- `docs/README.md` — Clarified navigation; confirmed environment locations.
- `docs/local-deployment.md` — Corrected dev app-of-apps path; Vault toggle via values.yaml.
- `docs/aws-deployment.md` — Replaced valueFiles patching with values.yaml toggle; auto-sync.
- `docs/troubleshooting.md` — Updated checks and updates to use values.yaml toggle and commits.
- `docs/implementation-diagram.md` — New diagram of GitOps flow.
- `bootstrap/README.md` — Confirmed apply order; removed Flux-specific CRD example; clarified repos note.
- `clusters/staging/README.md` — Pointed to `environments/staging/*` files; fixed commands.
- `clusters/production/README.md` — Pointed to `environments/prod/*` files; fixed commands.
- `applications/web-app/README.md` — Removed references to non-existent values files; clarified Argo CD flow and Vault toggle.

## Major Improvements

- Aligned all docs with current repo structure and GitOps flow.
- Removed manual Argo CD patch flows and incorrect `values-vault-enabled.yaml` references.
- Clarified environment locations under `environments/<env>/` and app discovery mechanism.
- Added implementation diagram to aid onboarding and reviews.
- Standardized instructions to edit `applications/web-app/k8s-web-app/helm/values.yaml` and rely on Argo CD auto-sync.

## Best Practices Reinforced

- Declarative configs, environment isolation, app-of-apps pattern, and pull-based deployments.
- Avoid large inline Helm values; prefer external files in env apps (already used).
- Troubleshooting covers Argo CD sync, Vault, monitoring, and resource issues.

## Still Needed / Future Docs

- `docs/architecture.md` deep pass for consistency with new diagram styling and validation script references.
- Infra module READMEs (`infrastructure/terraform/modules/*/README.md`) verification for versions and examples.
- Screenshots or step images for Argo CD UI (optional).
