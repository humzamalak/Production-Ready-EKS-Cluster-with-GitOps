# Acceptance Testing Guide

This guide explains how to validate infrastructure and application changes before promoting them to production.

## Purpose
- Ensure all changes meet functional, security, and performance requirements
- Automate validation and user acceptance testing (UAT)

## Steps
1. **Write automated tests** using Terratest and Checkov (see `/tests` directory)
2. **Run tests** as part of the CI/CD pipeline
3. **Validate results** and address any failures before merging
4. **Conduct UAT** with stakeholders as needed

## Best Practices
- Cover all critical infrastructure and application paths
- Use static analysis to catch issues early
- Document all test cases and results

## Troubleshooting
- Check test and CI/CD logs for errors
- See the main [TROUBLESHOOTING.md](../TROUBLESHOOTING.md) for more help
