feat: Complete GitOps repository audit and restructuring to v2.0.0

BREAKING CHANGES:
- Restructure directories for multi-cloud support
- Directory renames: argocd/ → argo-apps/, apps/ → helm-charts/
- Terraform reorganization: infrastructure/terraform/ → terraform/environments/aws/

Major Changes:
- Create 6 GitHub Actions CI/CD workflows (validate, docs-lint, terraform-plan, terraform-apply, deploy-argocd, security-scan)
- Consolidate scripts from 12 to 8 (33% reduction)
- Consolidate documentation from 23+ to 6 core files (74% reduction)
- Remove 22 obsolete files (~500KB saved)
- Enhance Makefile with help target and 45+ organized targets (96% increase)
- Add VERSION file and audit reports in reports/ directory

New Features:
- Multi-cloud ready Terraform structure (terraform/environments/aws/)
- Automated validation on every PR (YAML, Helm, Terraform, ArgoCD, scripts)
- Documentation quality checks (markdown linting, broken links)
- Infrastructure planning with policy checks (IAM, S3)
- Automated deployment with version tagging
- Weekly security scanning (Trivy, tfsec, Checkov, kubesec)
- Safe cleanup script with dry-run mode and backup/rollback
- Auto-generated Makefile help system

Documentation Updates:
- Create docs/ci_cd_pipeline.md - GitHub Actions documentation
- Create docs/scripts.md - Comprehensive scripts guide
- Update all deployment guides with new paths
- Document upstream Helm chart usage explicitly (Prometheus, Grafana, Vault)
- Update README.md with new structure and CI/CD section
- Add v2.0.0 entry to CHANGELOG.md with migration guide

Audit Reports:

- reports/IMPLEMENTATION_COMPLETE.md - Implementation summary

Files Removed:
- 13 root troubleshooting MD files (content consolidated into docs/)
- 3 duplicate documentation files

- scripts/cleanup.sh - Safe file cleanup
- .github/workflows/* - 6 CI/CD workflows
- .github/markdown-link-check-config.json - Link checker config
- docs/ci_cd_pipeline.md - GitHub Actions documentation
